# React Spring Web App

As I learn ReactJS, I am going to be working on this web app. My plans are to make it an all-in-one productivity app that integrates with your google account. I will be using spring for the server.

# Directions

## Pre-requisites

-   Node
-   npm
-   java 8
-   docker
-   docker-compose
-   linux machine
-   pm2

## Front End

1. After cloning the repository, cd into the front end folder
2. Run 'npm i'
3. Run 'npm start'
4. This will run the development version

\*note: Currently rest calls are not working

## Back End

1. cd into the back_end folder
2. type './docker.sh'
    1. This will do everything for you
3. The project will be exposed on port 5000
