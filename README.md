# React Spring Web App

As I learn ReactJS, I am going to be working on this web app. My plans are to make it an all-in-one productivity app that integrates with your google account. I will be using spring for the server.

# Directions

## Pre-requisites

-   Node
-   npm
-   java 8
  -  Open source is alpha
-   docker
-   docker-compose
-   linux machine
-   pm2

## Front End

1. After cloning the repository, cd into the front end folder
2. Run `yarn start` to run the development server
3. Run `yarn build` to generate the production build
4. run `./pm2StartScript` to build and serve using pm2

## Back End

1. cd into the back_end folder
2. type './docker.sh'
    1. This will do everything for you
3. The project will be exposed on port 5000
